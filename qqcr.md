# Question, Quote, Comment, and Reply (QQCR) Assignment

## Assignment Description
**QQCR**, or Question, Quote, Comment, and Reply, is a short weekly assignment on the readings to help you reflect on the readings and contribute to an ongoing class discussion.
We expect there to be a range of opinions in this classroom. 

To complete a QQCR, post a question, quote, comment, or reply on your assigned Ed section for a reading. This semester, we've split the course into five Ed sections to encourage more meaningful discussion.
  * **Question**: Make a new thread under the megapost with a question about the reading and any needed context for others to follow up. You should include the text `[Question]` at the beginning of your post.
  * **Quote**: Make a new thread under the megapost that highlights a quote, and your comment/reaction to that quote. You should include the text `[Quote]` at the beginning of your post.
  * **Comment**: Make a new thread under the megapost with a comment about the reading. You should include the text `[Comment]` at the beginning of your post.-
  * **Reply**: Make a response on someone else’s thread for a reading.

Multiple QQCRs compose a **QQCR set**. One QQCR set is assigned per lecture.

## Grading
* To receive satisfactory credit for a **QQCR set** for a given lecture, you must make **three QQCRs** total on any of the readings, where one of your QQCRs needs to be a reply.
  * In other words, you must make one Reply on someone else’s thread on one of the associated Ed megaposts in the reading set. In addition, you must also make two of Questions, Quotes, Comments, and/or Replies on Ed in the reading set. Note that these three QQCRs do not need to be on the same reading.
  * For example, a QQCR set could consist of a mix of one Question on one reading, and two Replies on a different reading. Or, a QQCR set could consist of three Replies on the same reading.
  * You are responsible for completing all readings in the set, regardless of whether you make a QQCR on a given reading.
* **You are expected to complete your QQCR sets prior to the corresponding lecture time.** This ensures a rich discussion during class. If readings are assigned for Week 3, you should finish the three QQCRs for that set of readings prior to the start of lecture that week.
* For QQCRs, you only get credit for posting on Ed.
* One-word posts will not receive credit. Most other posts longer than 50 characters will.
* You are permitted up to **{{ site.n_qqcr_drops }} QQCR set drops** this semester. That means that if you satisfactorily submit at least {{ site.n_qqcrs_min }} of {{ site.n_qqcrs }} sets of QQCRs, you will pass this course component. Lecture 1 does not have a QQCR set.
* It is OK if one or more of your QQCRs are on the same thread.

<!--* It is OK for you to post anonymously, meaning your name will be anonymous to fellow classmates but visible to course staff (who will use it for tracking assignment credit).-->
<!--* You do not get credit for posting about optional readings.-->

<!--
  * We reserve the right to give you a zero on a QQCR, or remove your grade for it if we deem your post to be egregiously low-effort. We will inform you and likely allow you to redo this QQCR if this occurs.
  * You *should* post in the **Ed megapost** that course staff create for each reading.
  * You *should not* make private or separate public Ed posts. Doing so will not earn credit. Early on, we might make an effort to merge your posts to the respective Ed megapost, but ultimately you are responsible for moving your posts to the megapost. 
  * "Heart"s on other student posts are encouraged but unfortunately do not count for credit (we have no way of tracking hearts).

## Formatting

For formatting, we ask that you separate out each QQCR into a different post. They can all be in the same thread, but each should be posted separately. This serves two purposes. For one it makes grading easier, but more importantly it makes replies easier for your peers since they will only be responding to one thing and the train of thought is more clear. 

We also ask that you put a tag indicating which kind of QQCR each post is. For example if you are making a 'quote' post, please put \[Quote\] in the body of the post. As before, this serves the purpose of making grading easier and making it easier for your peers to scan through the responses to a particular post when deciding where to comment.

## Late Policy and Regrades

Please see the [Accommodations and Late Policy]({{site.baseurl}}/syllabus/#accommodations-regrades-and-late-policy) section of our Syllabus for more details.

We have a bot that should catch most formatting errors you could make. If you get a 0 on a QQCR and you expect to have gotten a grade on it, feel free to submit a [regrade]({{site.baseurl}}/syllabus#accommodations-regrades-and-late-policy).
