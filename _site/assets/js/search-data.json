    "content": "Pick a topic, a related piece of media, and a CS195 classmate (or two). Talk about the topic a bit (this defines “a podcast”). Peer review others’ podcasts. Podcast Details . One of the learning goals of this course is to share and engage your opinions about the social implications of computing technology, particularly with others. Since most of you will engage with these implications through spoken conversation, we’re hoping that this will be a better simulation of what you will do in practice—as opposed to a written essay. You will record a 7-10 minute audio file of you talking with one or two other people in the course, then peer review two other podcasts. This does not have to be an Audible/Spotify-level production, but the audio quality should be clear enough such that an automatic captioner would reasonably be able to pick up on most words. We share some resources for recording audio at the end of this assignment. The goal of this assignment is a conversation between classmates. You do not need to submit a written script (beyond any automatic transcription; see below). However, both you and your partner should speak roughly an equal amount of time, and there shouldn’t be too many extra-long pauses (e.g., 5-10 seconds of pausing every once in a while is fine, but a longer amount of silence is not). Heuristically, aim for the amount of speaking you see in a podcast or internet stream. With these two things in mind (no script required, but conversation should keep both parties engaged), if you need it, we encourage you to outline some thoughts ahead of time. You may need to do several recordings! . Project Group Formation . Groups are 2-3 students total (that is, you and 1-2 other students). Podcast 1: . Submit the CS 195 Group Matching Google Form to register your group and/or provide preferences for random group assignment. | If you have a group in mind, please provide their emails through this sheet. If you do not have a group in mind, please submit this form and we will try to assign you to a group that matches your group work preferences. | Please submit the above form on time. The form counts as one of the required surveys in this course. | If you do not submit the form on time, you will be randomly assigned a group. | After the form closes, we will email each group and include student contact emails. Please let us know if you do not receive your group assignment within a week of filling out the form. | . Podcast 2: . We assume your groups will be the same from last podcast, but if you want to switch you may email cs195@berkeley.edu by 11/12 at 11:59pm with your request for a group change. People whose partners have dropped or had other extenuating circumstances have been informed of their new groups. If you would still like a group change, we prefer that you inform everyone involved prior to requesting the change so both new groups formed will have time to make plans to work together. Here are some things that we’d like from your email if you request a partner change and you know who you want to work with: . | CC your requested new partner(s) on the email | Your name and the name(s) and email(s) of your new partner(s) | The names and emails of your and your requested new partner(s)’ old partners | [Optional] Reasoning for the change | . If you would just like to have a different partner or work alone and you don’t have anyone in mind we can accommodate. If you request a partner change and don’t have anyone in mind, there is a chance that you will have to work alone. Please send us: . | Your name and the name(s) and email(s) of your old partner(s) | [Optional] Reasoning for the change | . Topic Choice and Required Media . Topic choices: . | Podcast 1: From Week 02: Free Speech up to and including Week 07: Government Surveillance. You must pick a topic related to what we will have covered in lecture. | Podcast 2: From Week 08: Generative AI up to and including Week 15: Tech and Labor II and Closing. Or, you can choose your own topic, so long as it is related to the themes of this class. | . As part of your discussion, cite or discuss one external news article, tweet, video from Tiktok/YouTube/etc., academic paper, or other relevant form of media that is outside of the ones discussed or shared in class. You can include multiple of these if that’s what you want to talk about, but just one is required for submission. Both the topic and the title/author of your external media piece should be stated at the beginning of the podcast. If you are choosing your own topic, we encourage you to find a succinct, 2-5 word phrase for the topic, before you dive in. If the media is not titled (e.g., a tweet), you should say as much of it as needed for a listener to look up the tweet (e.g., read the short tweet aloud). Peer Review . As part of the grading process for this course, each person will anonymously submit two (2) peer reviews per podcast. Each peer review consists of the following: . (1) Submit the grading rubric for the peer submission. (2) Post a text comment on the peer submission. | Post a question, quote and discuss, or comment on your classmates’ podcast. See the QQCR guidelines. | Submit this as a text comment in the peer review assignment you are assigned to. | Just like for QQCRs, you should be civil in your responses. Your classmates have worked hard on this assignment, and they will read your comments! One rule of thumb for constructive commenting: Instead of “I don’t like/I disagree,” say “I like” and “I wish…” | See the syllabus for our Community Guidelines. | . ",

CS H195 discussions complement and supplement the topics presented in CS 195 lecture series. Students are expected to engage at a deeper level with the assigned weekly readings and be prepared to engage in thoughtful and constructive discussions around the course material. Where applicable, we will invite guest speakers from industry and academia to present their work and to participate in discussions alongside students. CS H195 will encourage students to go beyond thinking about computer technology as solely an engineering problem but instead viewing it holistically from the perspective of social sciences, legal studies, policymaking, equity, and inclusion. CS H195 is a 3-unit class with the following expectations: . | In addition to CS 195 lecture, you attend 90-minute in-person discussion sections led by a GSI, once weekly. | You will actively discuss each CS 195 topic in more depth. | You will work on interesting projects / papers that replace the usual CS 195 assignments. | .
